Type P朝ny朝n
===========

Inputting hanzi (Chinese characters) now is an easy thing to do with the help of pinyin input method, but do you know how to input pinyin itself? I mean, the real p朝ny朝n instead of pin1yin1? Well, by using this Rime scheme, you only need THREE hits to input the pinyin of any hanzi. Yes, with tones!
